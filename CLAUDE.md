# CLAUDE.md — seed / bootstrap placeholder

> **This is a self-initializing seed, not a finished runtime prompt.**

## Agent

This repository hosts the **spanish-cli** agent.

## Description

Agent + CLI that turns Claude into a private Spanish tutor: track progress, get an overview, get advice, read stories, and learn & practice Spanish (written and spoken) online from your phone.

## Re-init instruction

This file is a seed. To expand it into your full runtime prompt:

1. Open this repo in Claude Code (or your preferred AI assistant).
2. Run `/init` — the assistant will read the repo, incorporate the description
   above, and replace this seed with a complete `CLAUDE.md`.
3. Commit the result.

Until you run `/init`, `spanish-cli` satisfies the `steward doctor`
`prompt-file-present` and `backend-consistency` invariants (a `CLAUDE.md`
exists and `culture.yaml` declares `backend: claude`) but the prompt is not
yet tailored to this agent's domain.
